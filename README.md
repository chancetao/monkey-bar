## Background

Initially we built this project to participate in a hackathon to build an internal community of programmers, then the event ended and I desperately needed a blog site to keep track of my Principle of Compilation readings, so I continued to transition development on that basis with the goal of becoming a freely deployable internal technology sharing platform.

> This project is in the development phase.
